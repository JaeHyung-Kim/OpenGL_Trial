# OpenGL_Trial
OpenGL project with interpolation, swept surface, ray tracing, etc.

At every projects, there is report to help you understand and execute program, written in korean.

All requirements are also written in report.


## 1. hierarchy
OpenGL hierarchy is represented with sit-up motion.


## 2. trackball
With using quaternion, implement trackball. Drag, transition, zomm in/out and dolly in/out is implemented.

## 3. swept surface
Input is txt file, full of coordinates of points. Then, with catmull-rom or b-spline interpolation, the swept surface is rendered.

## 4. scene
By using openGL, billiard room is implemented.

## 5. ray tracing
By not using any rendering software, each implemented function of each ray from eye is tracked and calculated.
